# Why this topic?
Congestion is an extreme issue in India as the quantity of vehicles have expanded altogether since years. As it is a noteworthy concern which adds to the street activity, the Developing Vehicular Populace, has prompt infringement of speed limits. 
To check this issue, distinctive nations have different methods to recognize and track vehicles. Essentially, in India we have different techniques like Kalman Filter and Lucas Kanade which can be utilized. Using the above two methods, we gauge the speed utilizing a succession of video pictures from an uncalibrated camera. Subsequent to contrasting both the techniques, the outcomes from error rate will give us a thought which calculation is more appropriate.

# Actual Work
- Developed a stand-alone application that calculated the speed of the moving vehicle when captured through cameras.
- Initiated the two image processing algorithms to obtain the values of the calculated velocity and the actual speed.
- Drawn conclusions based on the patterns of Optical Flow and K-Nearest Neighbor using MATLAB, which gave an accuracy of about 75% and 82%, respectively.

# Published Work
- The entire process adopted for the project has been drafted in form of a paper.
- It has been published on International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology.
